EECS 560: Lab 3

To build:
> make

To run:
> ./Lab3

currently, the program will run both tests. But, if you would like
to only run 1 test, open main.cpp and comment either 
1) "#define _PART_1_"
OR
2) "#define _PART_2_"
for the part that you don't want to run.

Running part 2 alone takes about 15 minutes.
